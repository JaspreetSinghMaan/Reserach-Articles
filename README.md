## 1. Multi-channel generalized pseudo-Jacobi-Fourier moments for color image reconstruction and object recognition
## Abstract
```markdown
The generalized pseudo-Jacobi-Fourier moments (G-PJFMs) which are orthogonal and rotation invariant are characterized by a free parameter and the classical pseudo-Jacobi-Fourier moments (PJFMs) are the special case of G-PJFMs. In this paper, we have proposed the multi-channel G-PJFMs (MG-PJFMs) using the multi-channel framework and analyzed the effect of the free parameter on color image reconstruction and color object recognition under various geometric transformations and noisy conditions for G-PJFMs. The detailed experimental analysis provides the optimum values of the free parameter for these image analysis tasks.

## 2. Multi-channel versus quaternion orthogonal rotation invariant moments for color image representation
## Abstract
```markdown
Orthogonal rotation invariant moments (ORIMs) have been used in many pattern recognition and image processing applications in the last three decades. Most of the applications relate to monochrome and gray-scale images. Recently, the theory of image moments for gray-scale images has been extended to color images using quaternion moments to explore the benefit of color information while representing the color images by moments. In this paper, we propose multi-channel ORIMs (MORIMs) invariants for color images and compare their performance with the existing quaternion moments, called quaternion orthogonal rotation invariant moments (QORIMs). The theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates the superiority of the proposed MORIMs over the QORIMs invariants in the color image recognition task. The experiments are conducted by considering Zernike moments (ZMs) and quaternion ZMs (QZMs) as the representatives of MORIMs and QORIMs, respectively.

## 3. Quaternion generalized Chebyshev-Fourier and pseudo-Jacobi-Fourier moments for color object recognition
## Abstract
```markdown
In this paper, the classical generalized Chebyshev-Fourier moments (G-CHFMs) and generalized pseudo–Jacobi-Fourier moments (G-PJFMs) have been extended to represent color images using quaternion algebra. The proposed quaternion G-CHFMs (QG-CHFMs) and quaternion G-PJFMs (QG-PJFMs) are characterized by a parameter , called free parameter, which distinguishes them from the conventional Chebyshev-Fourier moments (CHFMs) and pseudo-Jacobi-Fourier moments (PJFMs). All these moments are rotation-invariant and orthogonal. The effect of the parameter on image reconstruction and object recognition is studied in detail and its optimal values have been obtained for these two image processing tasks. It is shown that the choice of influences significantly the image reconstruction capability and the object recognition performance of the proposed QG-CHFMs and QG-PJFMs moments. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the behavior of these moments on image reconstruction and object recognition under normal condition and under rotation, scaling, and noise using COIL-100, SIMPLIcity and Corel datasets of color objects.

## 4. Geometrically invariant color, shape and texture features for object recognition using multiple kernel learning classification approach
## Abstract
```markdown
The geometrically invariant image descriptors are very important for recognizing objects of arbitrary shapes and orientations. We propose a framework for the fusion of the geometrically invariant descriptors representing color, shape, and texture for the recognition of color objects using multiple kernel learning (MKL) approach. To describe texture of color images, we propose an effective rotation invariant texture descriptor which is based on the Zernike moments (ZMs) of the gradient of the color images, referred to as the GZMs. For the shape features, we use the ZMs of the intensity component of a color image and also use multi-channel ZMs (MZMs) which have proven to be superior in performance than the quaternion ZMs (QZMs). For comparative performance analysis, rotation invariants of the QZMs (RQZMs) are also considered. Since the color histograms (CH) are known to be very effective color descriptors, we consider them for representing color. The five sets of features – CH, ZMs, GZMs, MZMs, and RQZMs are invariant to translation, rotation, and scale. The fusion of color, shape and texture features in different combinations using the MKL approach is shown to provide very high recognition rates on PASCAL VOC 2005, Soccer, SIMPLIcity, Flower, and Caltech-101 datasets.
